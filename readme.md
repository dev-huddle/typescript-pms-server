# Introduction

This server-side application is built to handle a wide range of tasks, including tenant management, lease management, maintenance scheduling, and much more.

## Current Features
Authentication and Authorization:
- Secure user login and registration.
- Role-based access control ensuring that users have appropriate permissions based on their roles (e.g., Admin, Property Manager, Tenant).
- JWT (JSON Web Token) based session management.

## Upcoming Features
Hotel Property Management:
- Integration of hotel-specific functionalities such as room booking, reservation management, and guest check-in/check-out.
- Support for managing hotel amenities, services, and billing.
- Technology Stack

This project leverages the following technologies:

- Node.js: A powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used for building fast and scalable server-side applications.
- Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building APIs and web applications.
- TypeScript: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
